# Themes by Domain

## Differences from Plain Refinery Theming

This version is a fork and modification of [refinerycms-theming](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms-theming)
   
Instead of allowing Themes to be set in a setting in the admin panel,
it allows a mapping from domain names to themes

This expects a hash 'theme_mapping' hanging off of your applications
configuration.

    FooApp::Application.configure do
       config.theme_mapping = {
        "dogs.com" => "dog",
        "cats.com" => "cat"
       }
    end

This will use the "dog" theme for any request for dogs.com and "cats"
for any requests for cats.com

Other than that follow the regular Refinery Theming suggestions.

## Introduction

__Themes allow you to wrap up the design of your Refinery site into a single folder that is portable.__

Refinery doesn't force you to learn a special templating language, but rather just uses the regular
ERB views you're used to in Rails. This means creating a theme from your existing site is extremely easy.

Think of a theme as your ``app/views`` directory with a few extra things like images, css and javascript.

It's worth noting you don't need to use a theme if you don't want to. Placing files in the ``app/views`` directory like any other Rails app will work just fine. It's only if you want to wrap your design up into a single location that you would use a theme or allow your client to easily change between designs.

## How do I make my own Theme?

__Uncomment the gem 'refinerycms-theming' in your project's Gemfile & run ``bundle install``__

Then, simply use the Theme generator to make the basic structure of a new theme.

    rails generate refinery_theme name_of_theme

Don't forget to "activate" this new theme by setting the theme setting to the name of this new theme. The __first__ time you create a theme, this setting will be created and set for you. If you already have a theme from an earlier project but no setting, you can create it manually in the __refinery admin / settings__ section. __The setting name is ``theme``__.


## The Structure of a Theme

Themes sit in your Rails app like this

    app/
    config/
    db/
    lib/
    public/
    themes/
      |- mytheme/
      |- othertheme/
    plugins/
    tests/

Let's take the ``mytheme`` example theme shown above. This is how the theme is structured:

    mytheme/
       |- images
       |    |- whatever.png
       |    |- foo.jpg
       |- javascripts
       |    |- whatever.js
       |- LICENSE
       |- README
       |- stylesheets/
       |    |- application.css
       |    |- whatever.css
       |- views
            |- pages
            |    |- show.html.erb
            |    |- index.html.erb
            |- layouts
                 |- application.html.erb


### Images

Usually this would be just what you have in ``public/images`` except we move that to the theme instead.

### Javascripts

Same with javascripts, just what you normally have in ``public/javascripts`` but in this theme directory instead.

### Readme

The ``README`` file is just a description of your theme.

### Partials && /shared Content

In the default views, you will notice lines such as:

    <%= render :partial => '/shared/header' %>

These are built-in partials for RefineryCMS. To __override__ these partials, run the command:

    rake refinery:override view=shared/* theme=theme-name

__theme=theme-name is optional__ but is convenient for keeping things together.


### content_for :body\_content\_title, :body\_content\_left, etc.

These are the default sections built up in __/shared/\_content\_page.html.erb__
You can add your own sections or rename these as you'd like. Say you wanted to add a left side bar, you could modify the __/shared/\_content\_page partial__ like so:

    sections = [
       {:yield => :body_content_title, :fallback => page_title, :id => 'body_content_page_title', :title => true},
       {:yield => :body_content_sidebar, :fallback => nil},
       {:yield => :body_content_left, :fallback => (@page.present? ? @page[Page.default_parts.first.to_sym] : nil)},
       {:yield => :body_content_right, :fallback => (@page.present? ? @page[Page.default_parts.second.to_sym] : nil)}.reject {|section| hide_sections.include?(section[:yield]) }

Where you'll see I added "body_content_sidebar". And of course you could set the fallback to whatever you like.

Including the partial /shared/content_page is what causes all your content_for blocks to work. So you would use

    <% content_for :body_content_sidebar do -%>
      blah
    <% end -%>

in this instance.

### Views

This is exactly the same as how you lay your views out in ``app/views/`` just instead of putting them in ``app/views/`` you put them into ``themes/mytheme/views/``

## How do I select which Theme Refinery should use?

In the admin area of Refinery go to the "Settings" area, locate the setting called "theme" and edit it.

Set the value of that setting to the name of your themes folder. For example, if your theme is sitting in:

    themes/my_theme

set it to ``my_theme`` and hit save.

## How do I install someone else's Theme?

Just copy their theme directory into your themes folder and Refinery will see it.

## How can I Convert my Current Views into a Theme?

This should be fairly straightforward, just follow the directory structure outlined in 'The structure of a Theme'.

But there is one important difference that need to be addressed to convert your current site into a theme.

If you have some CSS which refers to an image or URL:

    #footer {
      background: url('/images/footer_background.png') repeat-x;
    }

You need to update the URL so it requests ``/theme/images/`` instead of just ``/images``. This tells Refinery we need to actually load this image from the theme and not just the public directory.

So the result is simply:

    #footer {
      background: url('/theme/images/footer_background.png') repeat-x;
    }

This is the same with linking to Javascript and Stylesheets in your view. Say our ``application.html.erb`` layout had something like this:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application' %>

You just need to change that to:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', :theme => true %>

## I'm Stuck, is there an Example Theme?

Yep, there is an example theme called "demolicious" that comes with Refinery located in ``/themes/demolicious``. If you find yourself getting stuck, just check out that theme and get a feel for how it works.
